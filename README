Inconsolata LGC Short
---------------

This is a minor modification of https://github.com/MihailJP/Inconsolata-LGC
to shorten line height. Inconsolata-LGC adds Cyrillic chars, bold, and italic,
and has a VERY high line height, I'm guessing to accommodate the Cyrillic.
But it was much higher than the true Inconsolata, and didn't work for me,
so I took a quick stab at fixing it.

Line height was adjusted in FontForge, using the
instructions at http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/Line_Spacing.html.

Caveat -- this is the very first time I've ever messed with fonts, and I
didn't really learn much of anything in advance (although I've been a bit
of a typography geek for years). Apparently Levien's Inconsolata is destined
for more weights as well as italic. This is just a quick stopgap until then.

Note that this version includes the .ttf files in the same dir as the
.sfd files, unlike the original Inconsolata-LGC.

-------- Begin original README:

Inconsolata is one of the most suitable font for programmers created by Raph
Levien. Since the original Inconsolata does not contain Cyrillic alphabet,
it was slightly inconvenient for not a few programmers from Russia.

Inconsolata LGC is a modified version of Inconsolata with added the Cyrillic
alphabet which directly descends from Inconsolata Hellenic supporting modern
Greek.

Inconsolata LGC is licensed under SIL OFL.


Inconsolata LGC changes:
